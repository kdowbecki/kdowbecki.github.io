Stack Overflow was launched over 11 years ago. Since then more than 19 million questions were asked and only 
[Jon Skeet](https://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet) read them all. Below you can find a handful of 
my favourite questions. Each of them is answered in depth, providing a chance to learn something interesting.
